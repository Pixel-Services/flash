# Flash
Flash is a high-performance web framework for Java 21+, designed with implementation efficiency in mind. Unlike many popular server frameworks, initialization is performed ahead of time to minimize runtime overhead.

Routing is handled through a compressed trie (radix tree) for fast endpoint resolution. Request handling is multithreaded, with pooled handler instances that scale dynamically to improve concurrency and reduce memory allocation. Flash is entirely type-safe, zero-reflection and zero-dependency.
