# Flash
**Flash** is a lightweight and expressive web framework for Java. It is a fork of the popular [Spark Framework](https://github.com/perwendel/spark),
designed to offer enhanced performance, additional features, and a modernized development experience.

Flash is perfect for building RESTful APIs and simple web applications. Its minimalist design ensures
ease of use while maintaining flexibility and power for more advanced needs.
